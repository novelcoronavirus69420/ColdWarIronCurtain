 eth50.1.d:0 "Ever since the Haile Selassie has come to age, Ethiopian has had a wide and extensive outreach of foreign relations with Europe. Starting in the 1920s when Haile Selassie, then Ras Tafari, went on a diplomatic journey to the cities of Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm, London, Geneva, and Athens. During the Italo-Ethiopian War and the Second World war, Haile Selassie lead a governmment in exile in London and had strong relations with the allied nations. Since independence Ethiopia has continued this policy with Haile Selassie being seen around Europe as charismatic, likeable, and eccentric diplomatic leader."

With a new Italian government having undertermined relations with Ethiopia, and British Hegemony evermore undisputed on the fronteir of Ethiopia's borders, the future of Ethiopian interest is unclear.

The act offically initiates the transfer of Eritrea from British to Ethiopian control. While the chief executive of Eritrea is feeling the pressure of the Imperial Crown, the overall mood in Eritrea is initially positive."
 eth50.9.d:0 "Tedla Bairu, the first chief executive Eritrea has resigned last week in response to the policy towards Eritreans within the Ethiopian Empire. The Adis Abeba administration has dissolved the Eritrean constitution, banned the official use of the Eritrean and Arabic languages; and discouraged islamic minorities from practicing. Asfaha Woldemikael, his replacement has shown a much more status quo pro-amharic viewpoint in his local municipal office which has lead to his appointment as the Eritrean Chief Executive."
 eth50.10.d:0 "In keeping with the principle of collective security, for which Haile Selassie is an outspoken proponent, Ethiopia has sent a contingent under General Mulugeta Buli and Kebbede Guebre, known as the Kagnew Battalion, to take part in the Korean War.
