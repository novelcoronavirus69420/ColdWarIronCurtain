 AvroArrow.1.d:0 "The Arrow project has proven to be politically troublesome for the Canadian government. Recent trends in nuclear delivery technology seem to point to a greater role for Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, and diminishing importance of strategic bombers, leading some to question the value of a supersonic interceptor like the Arrow. Faced with mounting pressure to cut defence spending, and to align its aerospace defence strategies with the United States, the Canadian government has called a halt to the production of the CF-105. The cancellation of the project has put 15,000 Canadians out of work, and called the future of Avro Canada into question. Some in the Canadian Aerospace industry fear that the industry won't recover, noting that a significant ‘brain drain' to the United States is already underway. "			#Avro Arrow Cancelled
 AvroArrow.2.d:0 "Soviet bomber technology is advancing rapidly, and new high speed Soviet bombers are now able to carry nuclear weapons to North America. Canada is the first line of defense for North America, and if the Soviets send their bombers over the arctic, it will be the RCAF who intercepts them. In order to counter the Soviet bomber fleet, Avro Canada are proposing a revolutionary new fighter design. The CF-105 Arrow will employ a twin engine, tailless delta wing design aimed at maximising speed, payload, and fuel capacity. While some are skeptical of the high cost project, the Air Force insists it will produce one of the finest high speed interceptors the world has ever seen. With additional federal funding authorized, Avro expects the project to employ almost 15,000 Canadians. "			#Fund the Avro Arrow
 Gladstone.1.d:0 "James Gladstone a highly respected figure within the Blood tribe of the Blackfoot confederacy, has become the first status Indian to be admitted to the Senate of Canada. A prominent rancher, former member of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police, and president of the Indian Association of Alberta, Gladstone has long advocated for greater rights and status for Indians. Among the causes he's championed are better education, greater respect for treaty rights, and participation of Indian peoples in their own government. Now a fully-fledged member of Canada's upper house, Gladstone is making a strong case for extending the vote franchise to all Canadian Indians. With Gladstone's appointment to the Senate, many expect Indian enfranchisement to be forthcoming in the near future. "
 CCF.1.d:0 "Ever since the beginning of the Cold War, the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation has faced scrutiny from the Canadian public for their socialist leanings. The party's Regina Manifesto, which explicitly called for the nationalization of major industries, and the eradication of the capitalist system, has been replaced by a new statement of principles, the Winnipeg Declaration. The Winnipeg declaration has significantly moderated the party's stance, advocating for a mixed economy, and Keynesian rather than revolutionary economic policies. While this move to social democracy is a major change for the CCF, it remains to be seen whether their new direction will resonate any better with Canadians. Some of the party's ideas have, however, drawn significant attention, most notably their public healthcare proposals. "
 OrgAmer.1.d:0 "Despite its close relations with the United States, Canada has been skeptical of joining the Organization of American States. American adventurism in South America, conflicting British interests in the region, and dubious tangible benefits for Canada, have traditionally made the question of Canadian membership a low priority. Recent shifts in priorities have caused the Canadian government to re-examine this policy, and the OAS is now being viewed as a potential means by which Canada can pursue its interests in South America. Negotiations with the OAS have borne fruit, and Canada has been admitted as a full member state. Canada is expected to advocate for the promotion of democratic values amongst member states. "
 CanEuro.1.d:0 "Britain's economic interests seem to be drifting away from ties to her commonwealth partners. The British government has been preparing to submit an application to the increasingly prosperous European Economic Community. While potentially a major boon to the United Kingdom's economy and relations with its continental allies, the Prime Minister of Canada has expressed his concerns about the lack of trade guarantees with the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister has also been vocal about his disappointment that Britain did not consult with Canada or the rest of the Commonwealth on its plans to join the EEC. Though the spat may not have any particularly serious consequences for UK-Canadian relations, Canada is likely to pursue greater trading ties with the United States. "
 CanTrade.1.d:0 "The Prime Minister's recent tour of the commonwealth has reinforced his belief that the organization should play a key role in Canadian foreign policy. On a basis of the historic friendship between Britain and its former white colonies, and acceptance of non-white former colonies as equal partners, The Prime Minister plans to actively pursue the expansion of the commonwealth, both in size and scope. Greater trading relations, defence agreements, and consultation on international affairs of importance are expected to be a part of Canada's vision for a more integrated Commonwealth of Nations."
 London_Decleration.1.d:0 "Impending constitutional changes in India have prompted the Prime Ministers of the various Commonwealth states to reconsider the structure of the British Commonwealth. The Indian Prime Minister has made it clear that despite his desire to continue associating with the Commonwealth, he intends to see India become a sovereign republic, and end its royal ties with Westminster. Deliberations went on for the better part of the week, until Canada's Prime minister proposed a novel solution, wherein the King would hold an honorary position as Head of the Commonwealth, a common symbol of the free association of independent member nations. The Indian prime Minister has accepted the compromise, and a declaration from London has been issued, transforming the British Commonwealth into the Commonwealth of Nations."
