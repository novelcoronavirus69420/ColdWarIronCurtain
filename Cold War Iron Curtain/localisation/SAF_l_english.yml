 SAF_d_f_malan_desc:0 "Daniel Francois Malan has been in politics since 1914 when he joined the Nasionale Party. It is important to him that the Afrikaners should assert themselves as a single national community in the face of British cultural, political and economic hegemony. Afrikaner unity has been his dominant theme throughout his political career."
