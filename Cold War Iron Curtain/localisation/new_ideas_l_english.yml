heroin_epidemic:0 "Heroin Epidemic"
heroin_epidemic_desc:0 "Since 1930s, the finnish people have used the most heroin in the world. Used excessively in both wars, many veterans came home with a serious addiction. As far away as UN headquarters in New York, people wondered how it was possible that Finland - a country of four million inhabitants - could consume as much heroin in one year in the late 1940s as other countries use on average in a quarter of a century. In 1946, for instance, 99 kg. of prescription heroin was consumed in Finland. The somewhat cold response was simply that more heroin was needed for reasons of public health. However, attitudes are changing and soon, this small nation will have to do something about the epidemic that is plagueing it."
