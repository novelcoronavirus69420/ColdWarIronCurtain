 Tripura.1.t:0 "Tripura Merger Agreement"
 Tripura.1.d:0 "The State of Tripura was one of the ancient princely states of India. According to the Rajmala, Tripura was ruled continuously by as many as 184 Tripuri Kings with sovereign and independent status prior to its merger with the Indian Union in 1949, after the death of the last ruling King, Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman. His successor, Kirit Bikram Kishore Deb Barman, was thirteen years old at the time of the merger. King Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman had died in 1947, after which a Council of Regency was formed to run the administration under the presidency of Queen Kanchan Prava Devi, the mother of Kirit Bikram Kishore Deb Barman.\nWithin a few months after the unnatural demise of King Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman, Tripura faced a great crisis, with threats from internal as well as external forces. Queen Kanchan Prava Devi, as president of the Council of Regency, came under severe pressure to opt to join the Indian Union. On the advice of the Government of India, she dissolved the Council of Regency and became the sole Regent on 12 January 1948. More than a year later she signed the 'Tripura Merger Agreement', and with effect Tripura became part of Indian Union. It was thereafter administered by the Chief Commissioner as a 'C' Category State."
