  Angola_Civil_War.0.d:0 "Within 24 hours of signing the Alvor Agreement, the capital of Angola erupted into violence as the MPLA and FNLA started a struggle for control of the city. Many had hoped the Alvor Agreement would have resulted in a national government under the MPLA, FNLA, and UNITA that would establish peace in Angola, unfortunately this did not happen. The MPLA claimed the FNLA had attempted to assassinate its leader while the FNLA claimed the MPLA had engaged in a power grab. As the fighting intensified UNITA withdrew its personnel and fighters out of Luanda to its bases to the south. This opening of hostilities marks the beginning of the Angolan Civil War and a new phase of warfare for the people of Angola."
  Angola_Civil_War.1.d:0 "The uneasy truce between the three main Angolan parties, the FNLA, the MPLA, and UNITA ended in the capital. Soon after a new unity government was announced to transition the country to independence, fighting broke out between the MPLA and FNLA. The FNLA were accused of launching a coup and trying to assassinate the MPLA leader. After three months of fighting, the MPLA has finally driven the FNLA out of the capital. While the FNLA took many losses, UNITA fighters and supporters managed to withdraw in an orderly fashion. The MPLA said it acted to stop an FNLA coup backed by foreign powers. The FNLA claims it was all a conspiracy by the MPLA to seize power. Fighting among the three independence parties is expected to intensify as each has begun "
  Angola_Civil_War.2.d:0 "The Cuban government has long felt a revolutionary comradery with the MPLA in Angola. The MPLA in turn has repeatedly asked for help from Cuba and other revolutionary governments across the world. Over the previous weeks, the Cubans had responded to these requests by sending officers to assess MPLA needs. They have concluded the MPLA faces an existential threat from reactionary regimes and if they do not receive assistance soon, they may fall. With the final approval from the Cuban leadership, the Cuban military will begin deploying a large number of troops to Angola, via cargo ship and airplanes, in order to train, support, and bolster the MPLA against their enemies."
  Angola_Civil_War.3.d:0 "With the official deadline for Portugal granting Angola independence fast approaching, the FNLA launched an offensive to secure the capital Luanda. Doing so would give them legitimacy and take away one of the bastions of support for the MPLA. North of the city, the FNLA force decided to assault the strategic village of Quifangondo in order to have a base to secure the capital and control the water reservoir. Backed by South African and Zarian air and artillery support, the attack began early in the morning. However, a delay in the infantry assault saw the MPLA and their newly acquired Soviet rocket artillery operated by Cuban advisors devastate the attacking force. The FNLA lost almost all their vehicles and heavy equipment as they retreated. With victory assured the MPLA was poised to control Luanda when independence came."
  Angola_Civil_War.4.d:0 "With the official deadline for Portugal granting Angola independence fast approaching, the FNLA launched an offensive to secure the capital Luanda. Doing so would give them legitimacy and take away one of the bastions of support for the MPLA. North of the city, the FNLA force decided to capture the strategic village of Quifangondo in order to have a base to secure the capital and control the water reservoir. Backed by South African and Zarian air and artillery support, the attack began early in the morning. With MPLA forces dazed, the FNLA infantry immediately attacked, breaking through MPLA lines and forcing their enemy to retreat. The MPLA artillery could not be utilized in time as the FNLA poured through the lines immediately after their bombers and artillery finished softening the area. With the FNLA firmly secured, it appears they are poised to take Luanda before official independence is granted."
  Angola_Civil_War.5.d:0 "South Africa watched the rise of the communist MPLA very closely. They represented a threat to South Africa and were already organizing fighters to resist in Namibia. In order to prevent Namibian guerilla fighters a base of operations in Angola it was decided to support the FNLA and UNITA in their struggle against the MPLA. South Africa has initiated Operation Savannah to achieve this end. The operation began with South Africa launching a task force of conventionally trained FNLA fighters to attack the MPLA from the Namibian border. In the initial hours the task force has achieved great success and South African troops are preparing to move into Angola to support the mission. Ultimately Operation Savannah hopes to see the capture of Luanda and the end of the MPLA."
  Angola_Civil_War.6.d:0 "The FNLA task force of conventionally trained forces, working in conjunction with the South African military intervention force, have achieved lightening results. The MPLA have proven to be unable to resist the discipline and firepower of our forces. After a tough campaign and the arrival of foreign aid to the MPLA, the FNLA forces, backed by South Africa have completed the main objectives of Operation Savannah. With this success, it is hoped a moderate government will take over Angola and all support for Namibian guerilla fighters will be cut off, making them an easy target."
  Angola_Civil_War.7.d:0 "The FNLA task force of conventionally trained forces, working in conjunction with the South African military intervention force, had initially achieved lightening results. The initial MPLA resistance was quite meagre to the discipline and firepower of our forces. However, as Operation Savannah progressed, the enemy began receiving huge support in terms of equipment and foreign aid. Indeed, by the time the South African military realized it could not succeed it was apparent that South African forces were facing a better equipped enemy. Many South Africans blame the setback on a lack of international support to their efforts. Senior South African military officials also blame a failure of the government to secure international or media support for the operation."
  Angola_Civil_War.8.d:0 "The Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) announced its independence from both Portugal and Angola. Cabinda was a Portuguese protectorate and until the twentieth century was a separate administration from Portuguese Angola. However, the Angolan government claims it is a part of Angola proper and have rejected the declaration of independence. FLEC actively participated in the war against Portuguese rule but claims it had been sidelined during the peace talks and want a recognized state. Despite the proclamation, it is expected that Angolan forces my soon move in to stop FLEC."
  Angola_Civil_War.9.d:0 "The government of Zaire has long engaged in the conflicts raging in Angola. Initially Zaire hoped to support an African nationalist overthrow of a colonial state but overtime its ambitions grew to trying to install a friendly government. After a series of military victories Zarian forces managed to break through enemy lines and seize control of the Angola capital of Luanda. With Zarian troops celebrating on the streets, the Zarian government released a statement saying it looked forward to having a productive relationship with the legitimate representatives of Angola. Many observers expect the Zarian government to install a friendly regime, however, it is unknown if they plan on annexing areas of the country."
  
  #Restoration of the Kongo
  Angola_Civil_War.10.d:0 "\nAfter a series of military successes, the FNLA has secured a military victory over the MPLA and UNITA. With this victory, the FNLA now controls the destiny of Angola. The FNLA announced its intention to reestablish the state of Kongo and give the Bakongo people the homeland Portugal stole from them in 1914 with the dissolution of the Kingdom of the Kongo. By breaking up Angola, the FNLA hopes to give all Angolans representation and prevent future unrest. The FNLA had long relied on support in northern Angola and from the Bakongo people in particular. How the rest of Angolans will react to the creation of successor states is unknown but the FNLA remains confidence its decision to split the country will lead to a wider peace."
  #Savimbi Victorious
  Angola_Civil_War.11.d:0 "UNITA emerged as a group offering to secure Angolan independence and the establishment of a state which secured citizens equality. Despite facing adversity in terms of being able to secure arms, equipment, and men, UNITA has finally been able to emerge victorious and occupies the capital Luanda. UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi has kept the movement going from the beginning and across Angola citizens have taken to the street chanting his name. Savimbi released a statement declaring Angola would embrace democracy and nonalignment to ensure no foreign ideology or state will pervert Angolan freedom. Many Angolans will anxiously wait to see if UNITA can deliver on its promises."
  #Retreat of the FNLA
  Angola_Civil_War.12.d:0 "The FNLA has militarily become so degraded that its forces are withdrawing into Zaire. The military route began earlier and as the FNLA defeats continued, its forces began withdrawing in increasing chaos, with bands of FNLA fighters rampaging through villages as they fled. Foreign aid to the group has largely ended and remaining foreign mercenaries fighting with the FNLA have also largely abandoned the fight. Although they expect to occupy bases and safe havens in Zaire, the new Angolan government has pledged it will deal with the remnants of the FNLA and push for Zaire to remove the group."
  #MPLA Victory
  Angola_Civil_War.13.d:0 "In a press release, the MPLA party announced it had finally achieved the wishes of the people and emerged victorious over their enemies. Despite facing threats from two powerful Angolan groups backed by foreign powers, the MPLA was able to defeat both groups after a series of victories. Now that peace is secure, the MPLA has announced it will bring true socialism to the people and establish regional party headquarters across the country. This will allow the party to uproot counterrevolutionary elements, crackdown on corruption and hoarding, and begin the process of distributing much needed goods to the people of Angola. In response to these statements by the MPLA, many in Angola cautiously welcome the end of civil war and hope MPLA rule will lead to stability and prosperity, not purges or repression."
