 UIA_insurgency_options.1.d:0 "One of our Special Domestic Agents has successfully infiltrated the UIA and the informational gain is incredible. We have gained an unprecedented amount of data and a network of confidential informants who will aid our fight against the Ukrainian insurgency. Already, our network has discovered countless supply depots and is capable of dismantling countless operations, severely weakening the capability of the UIA to do damage against our nation.\nThis success will have profoundly positive implications and protect our nation."
 UIA_insurgency_options.2.d:0 "Following the failure of our Special Domestic Agent`s attempt to infiltrate the UIA, the UIA has patched several vulnerable points in their operations, improved their vetting process, and become more resilient as a whole. Additionally, although our agent resisted interrogation, they were able to learn more about us from his actions and in the coming days, may attempt to use these techniques against lower level targets such as police stations and garrisons.\nThis failure is a stain on our record and will have notable consequences."
 UIA_insurgency_options.3.d:0 "A hard crackdown on the UIA`s operations has resulted in astounding success. Our police forces were more than prepared to take down the enemy and caught them off guard. We have seized countless explosives, equipment, and killed many UIA operatives. Additionally, the raid has granted us large quantities of intel as they failed to destroy it in time.\nThis success will weaken their future operations and lower their ferocity."
 UIA_insurgency_options.4.d:0 "The UIA knew we were coming. They either evacuated their facilities leaving firetraps set to detonate when the police got deep inside, or established ambushes against our police. Not only has this resulted in a severe failure, but the enemy even mounted counterattacks against our police stations and launch opportunistic supply grab attacks while our officers were busy or dead. The UIA is now vastly more well armed and capable of future attacks in the area. For the time being, we have sent in police reinforcements from nearby areas and even assigned soldiers to patrols to bolster the now weakened Soviet forces.\nThis failure will weaken our attempts to fight them in the area and likely increase their ferocity."
 UIA_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "After several recon passes and countless hours of preparation, we finally launched our bombing strikes against remote UIA facilities. From apricot farms to beachside modern houses, their militia`s facilities were greatly weakened. Our strikes leveled training facilities, made opportunistic runs against supply convoys, destroyed staging areas, and generally knocked out remote bases. The UIA is now vastly weaker and the lack of these remote facilities will disconnect their network of cells operating between cities.\nThe enemy will now be less capable of making attacks and will be less aggressive in the future."
 UIA_insurgency_options.6.d:0 "Not only was our intel incorrect, not only did we destroy countless non-targets, but we actually somehow managed to destroy some of our own nation`s assets. Guard posts and our own army`s supply trains were ravaged by the misdirection. From what our intel director says, the enemy had been feeding our confidential informants misinformation. In the future we may need to coordinate better with the army to ensure that if we do fail, it will not result in friendly fire.\nThis failure will weaken the army`s capability to fight the insurgency and prevent attacks, making them more aggressive."
 UIA_insurgency_options.10.d:0 "The Red Army has proudly announced the complete annihilation of the UIA (Ukranian Insurgent Army). After years of fighting, the UIA has been utterly destroyed after a final strike against the remnants of the UIA wiped out the fleeing, remaining leader and killed off what few assets they have left. So many militant Ukranian independence supports died that the UIA is unlikely to be able to resurge.\nIn a press conference the head of Pravada, the Soviet Union's state media company, proudly announced that this should stand as a warning against all those who stand against the workers of the Soviet Union and its people.\nUkranian loyalists who aided in the fight as well as countless unnamed confidential Special Domestic Agents will be rewarded for their sacrifice and service to the Soviet Union."
 UIA_insurgency_options.11.d:0 "Following a brutal guerilla war and the destruction of critical Red Army airbases, the UIA (Ukranian Insurgent Army) has proudly announced that after years of fighting, Ukraine is free. The UIA has established an independent government and driven out all foreign officials and loyalist elements from the area. Thousands of Ukranian nationalists have lined the streets to celebrate the founding of an independent nation.\nIn a press conference, the leaders of the insurgency have declared that this should serve as an example to all revolutionaries across all countries that no nation is too big or too powerful to be resisted and that all who seek independence from the Tyranny of their rulers should stand up and fight.\nUkranian loyalists and KGB Special Domestic Agents have been brutally executed and key loyalists in the UIA will be rewarded by the group at large."

 kenya.1.d:0 "Oh sweet Chief, how we loved you so! Last night, the Commonwealth lost one of its most loyal and charismatic figures in East Africa. Just outside of Nairobi the beloved chief was being chauffeured when three gunmen shot through the car, killing Waruhiu instantly. Waruhiu was a true advocate for British colonial rule, an outspoken critic of independence groups and various indigenous people vying for unnecessary autonomy. These murderers are being referred to as Mau Mau, our secretaries are linking this assassination with multiple other murders and acts of violence towards white settlers in the colony and protectorate of Kenya."
 
 KLFA_insurgency_options.1.d:0 "Some of our Special Domestic Agents who have relatives who work in agriculture managed to infiltrate Mau Mau undetected. They will now be able to acquire lots of information from within` the organization mostly due to family trust. We will be able to track enemy movements and prepare to counter major operations with this gain. The SDAs, however, expect their family members to be pardoned after the insurgency is dealt with in return.\nThis success will have profoundly positive implications and protect our nation"
 KLFA_insurgency_options.2.d:0 "Our Special Domestic Agents attempted to get into Mau Mau through family members who work in agriculture, but it backfired horribly. The SDAs trusted their family members too much and let them know they were agents and were captured and interrogated or killed. Additionally, some agents have even chosen family over country and given them information on our counter insurgency operations.\nThis failure is a stain on our record and will have notable consequences."
 
 KLFA_insurgency_options.3.d:0 "A series of rural raids on towns housing land army insurgents has resulted in a resounding success. Hundreds of enemy insurgents lie dead in their homes and their assets have been seized by the state. We have taken their weapons and equipment for ourselves and any stolen goods they have are now forfeit. The auctioning of the now deceased insurgents will also bring in a sizable level of income, most of which will likely go to executive incentives.\nThis success will weaken their future operations and lower their ferocity."
 KLFA_insurgency_options.4.d:0 "An attempt to raid enemy locations in rural towns using police assets has backfired. Many local police agencies have close ties with the enemy and chose this opportunity to backstab loyalist officers. There are now countless small towns and villages that are fully controlled by enemy insurgents and out of the hands of government control. Additionally, the enemy now controls a larger stockpile of weapons and arms from the traitorous police stations.\nThis failure will weaken our attempts to fight them in the area and likely increase their ferocity."
 
 KLFA_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "Light jet firebombers have managed to destroy numerous known insurgent staging and training areas in the wilderness. In addition to scaring potential trainees, these bombings have caused a brain drain within` Mau Mau as numerous instructors have been killed resulting in a shortage of capable trainers within` Mau Mau`s ranks. A combination of the brain drain and scare effects will likely prevent the enemy from being able to maintain intensity in their attacks.\nThe enemy will now be less capable of making attacks and will be less aggressive in the future."
 KLFA_insurgency_options.6.d:0 "Our light jets targeted decoy locations rather than our intended targets. The enemy launched AA ambushes against our planes and took them down while they were targeting the cheap decoys. Losing these jets in the AO will allow the enemy to be more bold and take the opportunity to become more aggressive and launch attacks that could normally be prevented by air support.\nThis failure will weaken the army`s capability to fight the insurgency and prevent attacks, making them more aggressive."
 
 KLFA_insurgency_options.10.d:0 "\nAfter years of fighting, Mau Mau has been suppressed and what few supporters they have left are too afraid to rise again. The Kenyan rebellion, which desired an end to colonial rule, was suppressed by colonial forces and officially brought to an end with the capture of its leader, Field Marshal Stanley Mathenge.\nThe British colonial officials have released a statement that with the end of the rebellion, Kenya will likely remain under British rule for a very long period of time. Whether or not this is true remains to be seen as many of Kenya`s denizens still have serious problems with colonial policy and it may boil over in the future.\nRegardless, Mau Mau has been destroyed and the only thing that remains certain about the future is that they will not be a part of it."
 KLFA_insurgency_options.11.d:0 "After years of fighting, Mau Mau has successfully toppled British colonial rule and achieved their goals. The Kenyan rebellion, which desires to end colonial rule, has successfully driven out colonial loyalists and achieved their goals. Colonial garrisons were razed, British loyalists were expelled or killed, and the land armies of Mau Mau are returning to their farms.\nThe leader of Mau Mau, Field Marshal Stanley Mathenge, has announced in a press conference that this will bring on a new era of African independence from colonial oppression and promises to give Kenya “all that it deserves and was denied”.\nMau Mau`s success will mark a new chapter in Kenyan history and deliver a blow to Great Britain`s empire."

 UPC_insurgency_options.0.d:0 "The Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) published its declaration of independence, pro-independence riots broke out in Douala and Yaounde. Although the French colonial authorities suppressed the riots and banned the UPC, the UPC launched an armed struggle against the French. This escalation into armed resistance sees the end of over six years of tension between the UPC and French colonial authorities. French officials had sought to curtail UPC influence by suppressing voting and rejecting efforts to negotiate a peaceful transition for independence, but these tactics only pushed the UPC to war. For the UPC, despite having a leadership of men deeply connected to French culture and education, under Um Nyobe they have engaged in a more revolutionary path. This has alienated other Cameroonian elites who still look to France and reject the UPC`s call for resistance. They prefer to achieve independence within the colonial system."
 UPC_insurgency_options.10.d:0 "\nThe French military`s campaign of establishing pacification zones and breaking up the Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) rebels pushed the fighting to the west among the Bamileke. The first Cameroon Pacification Zone saw the population put under heavy surveillance, within designated camps. These efforts saw many UPC leaders captured and killed but similar efforts in the west did not completely succeed. France`s decision to grant Cameroon independence did not end the conflict as the UPC continued to resist what it saw as a French puppet state from its bases in the west. The new Cameroon government continued to rely on French military support as it continued a brutal counter-insurgency campaign that laid waste to many Bamileke villages. The recent assassination of another senior rebel leader seemingly broke the back of resistance as Cameroon appears to have finally defeated the rebels."
 UPC_insurgency_options.11.d:0 "The French and their Cameroonian allies today accepted the independence of Bamilekia. What had originally started off as an anti-colonial struggle transformed into the fight for the independence of the Bamileke people. The French and Cameroonians both engaged in a policy of establishing pacification zones to control and uproot the rebels. This effort in Bamileke areas of Cameroon succeeded in isolating the Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) fighters from the rest of Cameroon but kept them closely connected to the local Bamileke population. An alliance with the fighters and Bamileke elites ensured French and their Cameroonian allies` efforts in defeating the UPC were unsuccessful. Many among the Bamileke appear satisfied with their new nation and endorse a policy of reconstruction and socialism. However, there are also some elements who see Bamilekia as the legitimate government of Cameroon and desire to continue the struggle once the nation rebuilds itself."

The French government is cited to have destroyed entire villages including non-rebelling civilians.\n\nIt is unknown how many civilians were killed in these villages as records were not properly kept and it is unknown how many fled or escaped the attacks by the French colonial forces.

 SSU_insurgency_options.1.d:0 "The Sudanese government and military are both divided into warring factions who are constantly acting against each other. One of these factions opened communications with us and stated it would be in their interest to weaken the effort of government forces against our forces. One of our operatives has started exchanging information with a senior Sudanese military official from that faction. He is already exchanging intelligence on troop positions, morale, and tactical approaches, this information will prove invaluable to our efforts."
 SSU_insurgency_options.2.d:0 "In an effort to gain a local informant within the Sudanese government forces, we asked a Sudanese Defense Force deserter to change his identity and join a local pro-government militia. With his previous knowledge of the military we had hoped he would quickly rise in the militia and provide essential information for our forces. However, it appears he was identified by the government forces who managed to convince him to act as a double agent. We realized this after our forces in the area suffered a series of setbacks and before we could act against him he had already led government agent to capture the operatives who led this infiltration effort. The enemy has gained valuable intelligence and have greatly weakened Anyana influence in the area."

The lightening operation inflicted some enemy casualties, many of them simply fled, but more significantly we captured weapons and ammunition, critical to the cause."
 SSU_insurgency_options.4.d:0 "The Sudanese government managed to defeat an attempted raid by our forces. Although our men had the element of surprise, it appears they were spotted when moving in for the assault. This allowed a small force of enemy fighters to be rallied by their officer and they quickly counterattacked. The shock of the enemy action caused our fighters to fall back and retreat. We suffered several casualties and some men became enemy prisoners, greatly boosting enemy morale in the area."
 SSU_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "In a strategic area, our forces noticed the Sudanese government forces were manning a checkpoint at a key intersection during the day. Villagers and travelers were being stopped and checked in the hopes of hindering the movement of arms among our forces. In response to this, the local commander successfully planted explosives at the site overnight, when government forces arrived in the morning, the explosives went off, causing the government forces to withdraw and flee the area, raising our morale and standing among the people."
 SSU_insurgency_options.6.d:0 "Our supporters identified a local police station in a small village where some of our local fighters and supporters are being detained. We planned to bomb the perimeter in order to inflict casualties on enemy forces guarding the facility and maybe allow some detained men to escape. However, we underestimated enemy vigilance and two of our men were captured attempting to plant the explosives. The government has made a big show of their arrest and showed the locals the bombs, claiming we were targeting civilians, hurting our standing in the area."

 SUD_insurgency_options.1.d:0 "The Anyanya are riddled with factionalism and disorganization. Our intelligence and military officers identified a regional Anyana leader who has grown dissatisfied with the cause and would be interested in transitioning into a militia leader for us. Before we bring him into the fold, we are utilizing him to collect intelligence and Anyanya tactics against our forces. With this successful infiltration we are hoping to completely uproot and breakdown rebel influence in the region."
 SUD_insurgency_options.2.d:0 "Considering the diversity of South Sudan, it has been easy at times for our forces to rally and raise local militias to support our efforts to keep Sudan unified. A team of intelligence agents sought to take one of the local militia soldiers and sent him to join Anyanya force operating in the area. He would provide intelligence that would allow our men to uproot the rebels and detain their main supporters. However, this operation proved to be a failure as our mole appeared to have defected. Poor planning by our own agents saw the defector identify some of our local supporters in the village and the Anyanya fighters managed to target those men and capture weapons from the local armory."
 SUD_insurgency_options.3.d:0 "A blatantly obvious Anyanya-sympathetic villager was tracked to a local camp by a local militiaman. With this intelligence, the local military commander led our troops to assault the Anyanya rebel camp. The operation proved a huge success as the campus was taken by surprise. Though several rebels fled deep into the forest, we did inflict casualties and took prisoners. More significantly, most of the camps supplies and weapons were seized, no doubt weakening Anyanya operations in the area."
 SUD_insurgency_options.4.d:0 "An overzealous officer, who we suspect may have been seeking some quick glory to secure a promotion, led his men into an enemy trap. South Sudan is a vast land and the commander decided to launch a nighttime assault on a suspected Anyanya camp deep in the grasslands. The men were ill-prepared and easily spotted by the enemy. Instead of hitting the enemy camp, our forces were instead hit by an enemy ambush, causing us to suffer casualties. More humiliatingly, some men were even captured by the rebels. This setback has hurt morale and the regional commander fears government forces in the area may melt away if the rebels attack."
 SUD_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "The Air Force has made up for the lack of sophisticated equipment by modifying available aircraft to act as reconnaissance and even close air support aircraft. The ingenuity of our forces was apparent went our modified aircraft spotted a rebel camp from the air. The pilot went into action and hit the enemy. When our forces arrived at the camp, they found the Anyanya had abandoned their casualties, weapons, food, and documents. The cowardly rebels will no doubt fear the air and news of our prowess in the sky has raised morale."
 SUD_insurgency_options.6.d:0 "The Air Force has made up for the lack of sophisticated equipment by modifying available aircraft to act as reconnaissance and even close air support aircraft. However, despite the creativity and dedication of our pilots, a recent operation ended up in a major failure. A plane doing a local patrol spotted Anyanya fighters moving, the pilot reacted and dropped several bombs on the enemy. However, it turned out the pilot had hit a group of migratory tribesmen, we are not yet sure on casualties. This accident has only emboldened enemy forces in the area and has hurt our image in the area."

 SSU_insurgency_options.10.d:0 "The independence of Sudan saw the forced unification North and South Sudan. The administration and military of the new state was dominated by the northerners. This led to increased tensions as southerners soon felt repressed by the new government. A series of mutinies and protests in the south saw a rebel army called the Anyanya form from army deserters and rebel forces. After a series of engagements between the Sudanese government and the Anyanya a brutal attritional conflict emerged. To end the civil war and end the expensive stalemate, the Sudanese government and the rebels have signed an agreement in Addis Ababa. South Sudanese autonomy will be guaranteed in the Sudanese conflict, hopefully bringing an end to the long violence plaguing the country."
 SSU_insurgency_options.11.d:0 "After the independence of Sudan, the new administration and military was dominated by the northern Sudanese. This led to increased tensions as southerners soon felt repressed by the new government. A series of mutinies and protests in the south saw a rebel army called the Anyanya form from army deserters and rebel forces. Although the Anyanya sought to exploit the factions within the Sudanese government and military, they ultimately failed. The Sudanese military managed to overcome its problems and coordinated its efforts against the rebels. Anyanya forces were soon outmaneuvered, infiltrated, and broken up by Sudanese government forces. With the military victory secured, time will tell if Sudan will be able to politically unite the country."
 SSU_insurgency_options.12.d:0 "After the independence of Sudan, the new administration and military was dominated by the northern Sudanese. This led to increased tensions as southerners soon felt repressed by the government. A series of mutinies and protests in the south saw a rebel army called the Anyanya form from army deserters and rebel forces. The Anyanya were able to exploit the many factions within the Sudanese military to achieve stunning victories. After a series of successful campaigns across South Sudan, Sudanese military forces were soon driven from the land, leaving the area free for the Anyanya to establish political dominance over the population. With a military and political victory secure, the Sudanese government has accepted South Sudan as an independent state."
 SSU_insurgency_options.15.d:0 "Starting in 1955 shortly after the independence of the nation there has been a constant yet disorganized insurgency in Southern Sudan.  Now there are reports that larger, more organized insurgent cells have sprung up in South Sudan calling themselves “The Anyanya”. The Anyanya desire independence from Sudan and strongly oppose the central government. Enraged by marginalization and the imposition of Muslim rule over non-Muslim periphery groups, the Anyanya will not rest until South Sudan is free from the rule of the northern majority.\n\nThe Sudanese government has responded by denying the allegations of marginalization and are mobilizing their forces to suppress the rebellion. Already, there are countless clashes in South Sudan and other minority communities in the Blue Nile and Nuba Mountains are supporting the insurgents.\n\nAccording to reports, the Anyanya are being heavily supported by the neghboring and overwhelmingly Christian states of Uganda and Ethiopia."

The Anyanya desire an independent South Sudan while the government of Sudan wishes to maintain control over South Sudan and prevent the separation. Not only has this war taken on religous and cultural meanings, reinforcing the growing tension between Middle Eastern Islamic states and the non-Islamic states within the Middle East and its periphery.  Due to these factors, the war has become part of the larger conflict between these nations and is thus also a proxy war between the non-Arabic states in the region such as Israel, Ethiopia and the Republic of the Congo versus the United Arab Republic, Libya and other Arab states, while these states supply each of their sides other states such as Uganda wait on the sidelines weighing their options on which side is most beneifical to support."

 SMI_Jebel_Adkhar.1.d:0 "A local sheikh loyal to our cause has successfully managed to convince agents loyal the sultan he wishes to aid their efforts in the village. He has successfully become their local interlocker but secretly he works for us. The enemy give him vital information which he passes to us and he works to undermine their efforts from within. This successful operation has improved our position in the area, and we hope to replicate this success elsewhere."
 SMI_Jebel_Adkhar.2.d:0 "A local sheikh loyal to our cause has successfully managed to convince agents loyal the sultan he wishes to aid their efforts in the village. He has successfully become their local interlocker. We had hoped he would aid our efforts, but it turns out he has been seduced by the sultan and the wealth of his British masters. The sheikh has successfully helped the enemy uproot our supporters and hinder the operations of our fighters. Our efforts in the area have been undermined by this failed attempt to infiltrate the sultan."
 SMI_Jebel_Adkhar.3.d:0 "The sultan and his puppet troops are nothing more than British stooges. In a recent operation, our fighters easily breached a military checkpoint and attacked the soldiers present. We inflicted casualties, captured weapons, and many of the survivors simply abandoned their weapons and fled. With this outpost eliminated we have been able to move men and arms much more freely as the forces of the sultan appear unwilling to risk moving back to it. This operation has raised morale amongst our men as rumors spread that among the casualties was a British officer."
 SMI_Jebel_Adkhar.4.d:0 "A foolish leader of ours decided to lead his men to attack a royal outpost which he assumed would be lightly defended. However, upon launching the attack the enemy held firm and returned fire, driving our men in disarray. It appears the enemy were being supported by British advisors and they made short work of our attack. Setbacks like these will only hurt our morale and make men reluctant to carry out future operations."
 SMI_Jebel_Adkhar.5.d:0 "An enemy armored car traveling through one of our towns was destroyed today. The number of casualties is unknown, but rumors have emerged that a senior officer or even a British solder was among the casualties. A team of ours had seen the vehicle stopped and succeeded in planting an explosive on the vehicle. The operation was a great success and shows we have increased our sophistication in tactics."
 SMI_Jebel_Adkhar.6.d:0 "In one of our villages, an attempt to plant explosives near a military outpost ended in embarrassing failure. The men were detained with the explosives and taken for interrogation. Unfortunately for us the men betrayed several of our local facilitators and they have been detained as well. Our presence in the village has been largely uprooted. Conducting these sorts of operations are unfamiliar to our men and these failures can be expected but this has negatively effected morale in the area."
 
 OMA_Jebel_Adkhar.1.d:0 "The interior of Oman has long been the domain of the Imamate of Oman. However, their resistance has hindered efforts by the sultan to bring unity and development to the area. Intelligence operatives have identified several sheikhs in the interior who would be willing to provide us information on Imamate movements and curtail their activities in their regions in exchange for promises of development funds. In a recent operation we succeeded in turning one of these sheikhs to our side and the intelligence he has provided has allowed our forces to intercept enemy movements, thwart their operations, and identify Imamate supporters in the area. Successes like these will help us breakdown resistance to our mission."

Intelligence operatives have identified several sheikhs in the interior who would be willing to provide us information on Imamate movements and curtail their activities in their regions in exchange for promises of development funds. However, in a recent attempt to convince a sheikh to join us, our intelligence agent was tricked as we were given false intelligence. This led our men on wild goose chases and allowed the enemy to launch several daring strikes. By the time we realized we were being tricked, the damage had been done as the Imamate in the area has greatly increased their popularity and our forces are quite disheartened."
 OMA_Jebel_Adkhar.3.d:0 "A unit of Omani soldiers supported with several British military advisors discovered several Imamate fighters were assembling in a strategic village located near a prospecting site. These fighters no doubt are planning to target the prospectors but a daring raid, planned by the British officers, saw our troops storm the town, capture or kill the rebels and end the threat. The operation has raised the morale of our Omani troops and has increased the cooperation between us and the British."
 OMA_Jebel_Adkhar.4.d:0 "The biggest issue facing the Royal Army of Oman has been waging a counter-insurgency style of warfare few of its personnel and officers have trained for. The British advisors have been critical but are in short supply which has led to several failures like the recent operation to assault a hilly area suspected of being an Imamate staging ground. Our troops were ambushed before reaching the site and after taking casualties many simply fled in retreat. The British assessed the operation and cited a failure to properly plan, easily being discovered due to taking an obvious route, and a lack of effective leadership as the reason for the failure. This failed operation has weakened morale amongst our troops."
 OMA_Jebel_Adkhar.5.d:0 "The Royal Air Force based in Oman was directed by an SAS team to target a suspected rebel camp. After the bombing run, our Royal Army of Oman soldiers entered the suspected camp and found Imamate forces had abandoned the area, leaving behind their casualties, weapons, and supplies due to the awesome power of the aircraft. The operation has no doubt greatly hurt enemy morale."
 OMA_Jebel_Adkhar.6.d:0 "The Royal Air Force has been a critical support for our operations in the interior. They have identified enemy concentrations, destroyed enemy positions, and provided support for the Royal Army of Oman when under threat. However, in a recent operation, the Royal Air Force identified a concentration of rebel troops and deployed bombers who claimed to have destroyed the targets. However, when our troops moved in, confident the threat had been dealt with, they fell into an ambush suffering casualties. The failed bombing mission has lowered morale and brought questions into whether we can trust Royal Air Force claims of success and intelligence."
 
 OMA_Jebel_Adkhar.10.d:0 "The Imamate of Oman started its resistance against the sultan after it felt their autonomy was being encroached upon. They also believed future oil exploration would syphon the wealth of the area to the sultan and the British. Despite their resistance and guerrilla tactics, the sultan of Oman has triumph and announced the Imamate of Oman has now been integrated into his sultanate. The success of the sultan was due in large part to the aid he received from oil interests and the British government. British advisors and the Royal Airforce proved decisive in allowing the poorly armed military of the sultan to triumph."
 OMA_Jebel_Adkhar.11.d:0 "The Imamate of Oman started its resistance against the sultan after it felt their autonomy was being encroached upon. They also believed future oil exploration would syphon the wealth of the area to the sultan and the British. The resistance and guerilla tactics proved extremely frustrating for the poorly armed and led military of the sultan. Despite the support of British advisors and the Royal Airforce, the sultan could not suppress the rebels. Indeed, the successful resistance inspired other Arab nationalists and anti-imperialists across Oman to sympathize with the rebels. Once the forces of the Imamate began to operate within the Sultanate of Oman, these supporters joined the Imamate fighters and eventually the sultan was overthrown. With this victory, the Imamate of Oman has taken control of the country and Arabs across the region see it as a victory over international imperialism."
 
 OMA_Jebel_Adkhar.12.d:0 "The Sultan of Imam, the British government, and international petroleum companies were eager to explore the interior of Oman for oil. However, the autonomous Imamate of Oman were resistant to any effort it perceived as violating its autonomy. With British backing, the Sultan decided he would send soldiers to seize key areas and petroleum prospectors to determine the full potential of the region. This led to an initial occupation of Imamate lands by the sultan. Recently however, the forces of the Omani sultan are facing guerilla strikes from fighters loyal to the Imam, turning the conflict into an armed struggle over the interior of Oman and control over its natural resources. The British back the sultan while Arab nationalists and rival Arab oil states support the Imamate in its struggle against the sultan."

 #Eritrean War
 ERI_Eritrean_War.1.d:0 "As the oppression of Eritrea continues, a number of Christians in our lands have increasingly begun to join the cause. These supporters initially feared Muslim domination but now see an independent Eritrea is preferable to the current foreign regime. The Ethiopians are also desperate for local help and have relied on the Christians in the past. We have used this to our advantage in a recent operation where several Christian supporters joined the Ethiopian government as support staff at important administrative and military facilities. So far, these men have provided intelligence regarding Ethiopian strategy, policies, and troop movements."
 ERI_Eritrean_War.2.d:0 "As the oppression of Eritrea continues, a number of Christians in our lands have increasingly begun to join the cause. These supporters initially feared Muslim domination but now see an independent Eritrea is preferable to the current foreign regime. However, it appears we were tricked as an attempt to place several Christian supporters with the Ethiopians ended in failure. It appears one of the men quickly defected and began sending us false information, leading us to waste resources or suffer lives in fruitless operations. Once we had figured out his double game, he led his Ethiopian handlers to arrest our other agents, making the operation a major failure in intelligence gathering."
 ERI_Eritrean_War.3.d:0 "When a patrol of Ethiopian troops arrived to enter a military camp, our commander successfully ambushed the group, attacking them from multiple sides. The Ethiopian troops suffered casualties or ran from the battle. Our men were able to move in and quickly capture abandoned arms and ammunition before slipping away. By the time the Ethiopian military could muster a large enough force to fight back, our fighters were long gone."
 ERI_Eritrean_War.4.d:0 "An overly confident commander of ours made a costly blunder. In recent engagements his men had attacked several police checkpoints, easily driving off police officials and capturing their weapons. However, he decided to target a military checkpoint and his brazen approach left his men exposed. The Ethiopian troops did not immediately abandon their posts but held their position and inflicted heavy casualties among our men. Although the commander claimed to have inflicted even more casualties on the enemy, it is clear the attempted attack had been a blunder."
 ERI_Eritrean_War.5.d:0 "The Ethiopians illegal occupation of Eritrea took a large blow today after a group of our supporters blew up a municipal building in a large town. The structure had been built after the Ethiopian occupation and many Ethiopians brought to illegally administer our people utilized the building. Casualties are yet unknown, but the attack has already led some Ethiopians residing in the town to begin preparations to leave. With this success we have shown the people will not tolerate foreign occupation."
 ERI_Eritrean_War.6.d:0 "An attempt to bomb an Ethiopian military base ended in abject failure. Our men thought they could infiltrate the base from a poorly lit section of the perimeter but once inside they were immediately captured by a patrol. We expect the Ethiopians to harshly punish our men and expect them to publicize their success. The failure of this mission has weakened morale and hurt our standing with the population as we have been claiming our men can never be captured."
 
 ETH_Eritrean_War.1.d:0 "Historically, the many Eritrean clans have long been rivals of one another, indeed the initial independence movement was plagued by numerous factions and infighting. Although the rebels now appear much more unified, these old rivalries have persisted. To exploit this advantage our intelligence operatives recently approached a clan which covets a higher position within the rebel movement. They have agreed to provide us valuable intelligence on their rival and undermine the operations of that clan in exchange for cash and access to education and healthcare abroad. With this information we have successfully uprooted rebels from a key area. The clan has also agreed that it will advocate for a resolution to the conflict and minimize rebel activities in its areas."
 ETH_Eritrean_War.2.d:0 "Historically, the many Eritrean clans have long been rivals of one another, indeed the initial independence movement was plagued by numerous factions and infighting. Although the rebels now appear much more unified, these old rivalries have persisted. We attempted to do an operation in which our intelligence operatives approached a clan with offers of cash and access to healthcare and education abroad. In return the clan would give us vital intelligence on its rivals and guarantee they would reduce rebel activities as they became more prominent. However, this recent operation proved a failure, the clan collected cash from us and then seized our operatives. We believe they are being intensely interrogated and fear some of our intelligence assets within the rebel camp will soon be purged."
 ETH_Eritrean_War.3.d:0 "The Eritrean forces continue to conduct cowardly hit and run strikes and hide amongst civilians. However, in a recent operation a bold commander led our forces in a great victory over the enemy. The commander identified a village from which the attacks were coming and in a lighting raid he unleased mortars and heavy weapons as the infantry assaulted. The shock of the attack squashed any attempt at resistance and the village was quickly cleared of rebels. When faced with the might of the Ethiopian Army, the Eritrean fighters stand no chance."
 ETH_Eritrean_War.4.d:0 "A unit of our forces decided to assault a suspected Eritrean rebel camp. The united decided to use trucks in order to catch the enemy off-guard. However, the Eritreans appeared to have been prepared for our approach. The men met an enemy minefield and then had to advance on foot. By the then the enemy was notified of our plans and had dug in. We took heavy casualties before reaching the camp. However, by then the enemy had withdrawn and taken all their valuables with them, making the attack a costly mistake."
 ETH_Eritrean_War.5.d:0 "The Eritreans increasingly move with impunity and that has been to our advantage. An Airforce fighter observed a large movement of men in vehicles. We identified them as a rebel convoy and a group of fighters modified for bombing missions struck the convoy. The damage was immense and when a patrol reached the site, they found we had destroyed a convoy carrying men and heavy weapons. Intercepting this convoy will aid our troops in their efforts to dislodge the Eritrean rebels."
 ETH_Eritrean_War.6.d:0 "An army unit reported it had taken fire from an Eritrean rebel strongpoint and called on air support. We dispatched fighters who hit the reported target, however, it appears the bombs fell on a deserted field and managed to destroy a civilian farm equipment. There are no reported casualties and if there are, they are unlikely to be rebels. We suspect the unit that reported taking fire may have heard a loud noise from the farm itself and panicked, thankfully their coordinates did not hit the farmhouse itself. This operation proved to be a waste of resources and the rebels have been spreading rumors that our forces are bombing ghosts."
 
 ERI_Eritrean_War.10.d:0 "The Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) emerged as the premier anti-Ethiopian and Eritrean nationalist group following the unilateral annexation of Eritrea by Ethiopia. They fought the occupation initially with outdated arms or makeshift weapons, but overtime acquired more sophisticated arms and tactics. Yet despite their efforts, the Ethiopian military has managed to not only withstand their guerrilla tactics but following a series of victories they have largely uprooted the ELF. Resistance across Eritrea has largely ended and even street protests have stopped. It appears the people of Eritrea recognize Ethiopia is here to stay and to resist only invites more punishment. Whether Ethiopia can transition this military occupation into a proper administrative area will have to be seen. A failure to do so may invite more unrest in the future but for now Ethiopia has crushed the ELF."
 ERI_Eritrean_War.11.d:0 "After years of struggling, first against Italian colonialism, then the occupation of British and eventually Ethiopian rule, the people of Eritrea can finally be independent. Under the leadership of the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF), the Eritrean people looked past their own internal conflicts to unite in their mission to drive off the yoke of Ethiopian rule. This was achieved following a series of military victories and a recognition from the Ethiopian government that continued warfare would not result in a victory. Now that Eritrea has taken its place as an independent state, many will observe to see if the factionalism which plagues the region will return in full force."
 ERI_Eritrean_War.15.d:0 "The people of Eritrea long resented how Ethiopia seized control of their land long after their Italian colonial masters had been removed. The establishment of Ethiopian customs, governance, and people were seen as a fundamental threat to the Eritrean way of life. The early Eritrean independence movement had been riddled with internal strife, but following the annexation, these clans and factions must now unite as the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF). The war began with the Battle of Adal. A group of Eritrean resistance fighters, poorly armed and without proper leadership, managed to defeat and drive off Ethiopian police and military personnel from Adal. Many Eritreans now flock to join the ELF, but the Ethiopian government is also mobilizing its own forces to deal with the unrest."
