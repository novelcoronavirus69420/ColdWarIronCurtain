 greece.0.t:0 "Death of a Prime Minister"
 greece.0.d:0 "	Today Greece mourns one of its children. Themistoklis Sofoulis, our prime minister passed away at the age of 88. He was born in 1860 in Vathy in the island of Samos. He studies philosophy in the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and then went to Germany where he specialized in archaeology. He entered in the Greek political arena after the declaration of union between Samos and Greece in 1913. Prior to this, he was involved in the Samian politics and played a big part on the union process. In the election of May 1915, Sofoulis was elected deputy in the Greek parliament and served as Interior Minister under Eleftherios Venizelos. When in 1920 Venizelos became self-exiled, Sofoulis took the leadership of the party. In 1924 he became Prime Minister for the first time. During the interwar period Sofoulis was one of the central political figures in Greece. After the Greece surrender to the Axis in 1941, Sofoulis remained passive as almost all Greek Politician. After the liberation, he became Prime Minister until the april of 1946 and tried to prevent the outbreak of the civil war. However his efforts failed and as a result he abstained from politics for a short period of time. On 7 September 1947 he once again became prime minister in a coalition government of the Liberal Party and the People's Party. Sofoulis undertook further efforts to end the civil war, by proposing to EAM a general amnesty and a new coalition government between it and his party. However, these proposals were collapsed under heavy USA pressure and so the civil war took its course."

 greece.1.r:0 "We will see how this goes.."
 greece.2.t:0 "Alexandros Diomidis remains Prime Minister"
 greece.2.d:0 "After a few days of negotiations the Laiko Komma and the Komma Fileleutherwn agreed to support Alexandros Diomidis as successor to Sofoulis in the premiership. Diomidis takes office on the 30 of July 1949, with the Civil war still going.."

 greece.3.t:0 "Uniting the democratic faction"
 greece.3.d:0 "The old Venizelist faction is still split in various bigger and smaller parties. This makes very difficult to antagonize the Right which even though now is in the opposition, it seems that is gets stronger day by day. We focused many times on united the various Venizelists into one party, but the attempts were unsuccessful. However, a last chance to achieve that impossible goal is standing ahead..."
 greece.4.t:0 "Electoral reform debate"
 greece.4.d:0 "It is widely acknowledged that our current electoral system failed to provide the country with stable governments that are able to fulfill their term. As a result there is an increasing amount of voices advocating for a radical reform of the current system. They support that it is essential for the future of Greece to move towards an enhanced majority system in order to acquire stable governments and move away from fragile multiparty parliamentary majorities. Also both the US embassy and the Palace are clearly in favor of the enhance majority system. It would not be wise to oppose them. However, behind the proposed system there are dangers. We should forget that Papagos party came first in the elections, even though he failed to form a government. Adopting the enhanced majority system, we might unknowingly give him a strong one-party majority in the next parliament. "
 greece.6.t:0 "Alexandros Papagos Dies"
 greece.6.d:0 "In January 1955 prime minister Alexandros Papagos began to develop gastric issues, a result of his previous imprisonment during the war. Thus, he appointed Stefanopoulos to serve as provisional prime minister until he overcomes his illness. However, Papagos' condition kept worsening, until today, when our prime minister left his last breath due to a severe lung hemorrhage."
 greece.7.t:0 "Karamanlis sworn Prime Minister"
 greece.7.d:0 "After Papagos death, King Paul in a surprising move, appoints Konstantinos Karamanlis as Prime Minister. Karamanlis appointment took the Greek political life by surprise, because the King bypassed two senior members of Papagos party, Stephanos Stephanopoulos and Panagiotis Kanellopoulos who were widely considered as potential successors of Papagos. After becoming Prime Minister, Karamanlis reorganized the Ellinikos Synagermos as the Ethniki Rizospastiki Enosi."
 greece.8.d:0 "This morning, we received horrifying accounts that a series of earthquakes with a combined magnitude of approximately 6.8 hit the Ionian Islands of Kefalonia and Zakynthos. Two British Royal Navy vessels were the first on the scene to provide emergency aid and in initial reports the damage to the region appears to be severe. So far, casualties have been estimated to be at least 400 people dead and wounded, and the economic impacts of the quake appear extensive, as several top economists have already estimated the financial cost of the earthquake to extend into the billions."
 greece.9.d:0 "Prime Minister [GRE.GetLeader] has introduced new legislation! In reaction to the ongoing epidemic of young rabble rousers, the legislation has now allowed for punishment of their silly pranks and harsh words. Along with penalizing the use of foul language such as “gamo teen Panagia sou,” “skeela,” and “malakas,” the law also gives specific penalties for rapscallions who throw food onto or assault old people. Specifically, they will be taken to their local detention center, their heads shaved, and their parents prosecuted. Further, they will be shamed in the streets for their crimes! Though some protest the law due to its punishments, many celebrate [GRE.GetLeader]’s solution to the rampaging youths."
 greece.10.d:0 "Greece’s close alliance and cooperation with the United States has preserved its independence since the turbulent 1940s. The Greek people had dealt with occupation forces from Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In addition the nation has only recently come out of a Civil War which saw the defeat of the Greek communists. The outbreak of the Korean War has seen the United States call on all its friends and allies to contribute to the cause. Many in the cabinet and senior military officers believe Greece should offer equipment and men to demonstrate its commitment to its American allies and anti-communism. However, many politicians and everyday Greeks are of the opinion the country is too war weary and should not be involved in foreign wars. However, after close negotiations with its party members and political allies, the Greek Prime Minister was able to convince them to support a Greek intervention in Korea. The Greek military is now drawing up options with their American counterparts on how Greece can contribute to the struggle against communism in Korea. Supporters of the intervention say like the Greeks, the South Koreans are victims of communist aggression and it is only fitting that the Greeks come to aid them in their desperate defense."
