 ww_submarines:0 "WW2 Era Submarines"
 ww_submarines_desc:0 "WW2 era submarines were crude compared to more modern variants. Many of them needed to stay above water for extended periods of time before submerging because of the difficulty they had storing and acquiring air. Submarines play a primarily offensive role in naval combat using torpedoes to take out enemy ships and are also used to take down poorly defended transport ships. Although basic, WW era submarines can still fill this crucially important naval role and are better than not having submarines altogether."
 torpedo_ww:0 "WW2 Era Torpedoes"
 torpedo_ww_desc:0 "WW2 era torpedoes were anti-ship torpedoes comparable to light torpedoes in modern navies. Earlier in the war, most country’s torpedoes suffered serious problems such as not exploding when desired, running deeper than set, etc. However, later in the war most torpedoes were replaced with more refined and optimized variants including electric torpedoes. These later designs would pave the way for future torpedoes and define the doctrines used in development beyond the WW era."
 torpedo_small_0:0 "Early Small Torpedoes"
 torpedo_small_0_desc:0 "Early post war torpedoes followed most of the design principles of late war torpedoes including electric engines and contact detonation with gyroscope guidance. However, post-war torpedoes would also include newer components including passive cruise sonar. In addition to improvements to guidance and the addition of homing, they also had greater damaging capability and massively extended ranges, depths, and speeds."
 torpedo_small_1:0 "Small Torpedoes"
 torpedo_small_1_desc:0 "Following the early designs and improving them, later small torpedoes began to include greater technology such as active doppler homing and better warheads for explosives. These torpedoes also featured optimized propellers for greater agility and speed and modern materials that could allow them to be deployed at largely greater depths. This flexibility and agility allow submarines to take up more optimal or hidden positions and attack in areas more difficult for the enemy to defend from or plan around."
 torpedo_small_2:0 "Improved Small Torpedoes"
 torpedo_small_2_desc:0 "Continuing to make improvements to torpedo technology, torpedoes around this era were completely redesigned and replaced most of the doctrines from WW era torpedoes. Improved torpedoes include pump jets and swash-plate piston engines with monopropellant fuels. In addition to this, warheads were improved with more capable explosives and proximity fuzes. These torpedoes are also improved by adding better active guidance systems to aid them in actively seeking and engaging targets. It should also be noted that torpedoes in this era began to adopt lighter metals or alloys wherever they could get away with it allowing them to be lighter and stronger than ever before."
 torpedo_small_3:0 "Modern Small Torpedoes"
 torpedo_small_3_desc:0 "Modern torpedoes featured better acoustics, electronics, and materials. These modern torpedoes can even circle back in the event of a miss and attempt another attack if they have the fuel. Additionally, the better acoustics and electronics can greatly reduce the number of first chance misses. All of these improvements together allow for torpedoes to reach new heights of lethality."
 torpedo_small_4:0 "Advanced Small Torpedoes"
 torpedo_small_4_desc:0 "With the new century comes new technologies and new challenges for torpedoes to face. The countermeasures, defenses, and improved materials of the modern era have lent themselves to the need for better guidance systems, more speed, and higher explosives. CBASS [Common Broadband and Advanced Sonar System] technology enables advanced torpedoes to engage targets much further away. Optimizations in structural integrity and propulsion systems allow them to be used at greater depths. These submarines can also monitor surrounding electrical and magnetic fields to enabled high-precision detonation fuzes and allow for active guidance to hit ships in preferred locations."
 torpedo_medium_0:0 "Early Medium Torpedoes"
 torpedo_medium_0_desc:0 "By simply upgrading the quantity of explosives and increasing the size of the guidance systems and engines in torpedoes, you can greatly increase their firepower. This does, however, require the development of a better structure and extended engine system to carry the increase in weight. Various improvements to these fields enabled the development of larger and more powerful torpedoes post-war."
 torpedo_medium_1:0 "Medium Torpedoes"
 torpedo_medium_1_desc:0 "While large ships began to fall out of favor with most navies, including some navies giving up heavy/battlecruisers altogether in favor of more numerous, harder to hit cruisers, the need for more powerful torpedoes did not end. Greater levels of anti-sub technology and sub detection technology created the need for longer range torpedoes. The easiest solution is to simply create larger torpedoes that can hold more fuel and have stronger engines to go further and hit their targets from farther away. This does, however, place a greater level of weight on the need for better guidance systems and long-range submarine targeting capability making the problem more complex than simply having a bigger torpedo."
 torpedo_medium_2:0 "Improved Medium Torpedoes"
 torpedo_medium_2_desc:0 "The new doctrines and routes taken in torpedo designs make previous methods for upgunning torpedoes obsolete. Increasing the size of swash-plat piston engines and pump jets is not as easy in the confines of a torpedo as it is on a ship. A lot of the rear structures of the torpedo needed to be modernized and redesigned. However, due to new technologies, this was easier to create than former heavyweight torpedoes."
 torpedo_medium_3:0 "Modern Medium Torpedoes"
 torpedo_medium_3_desc:0 "One of the key improvements made to develop modern torpedoes was the ability to circle back for another shot at a missed enemy. In order to equip heavyweight torpedoes with this capability, the structure had to be lighter and the engines had to be updated."
 slbm_tube_1:0 "Early SLBM Tube"
 slbm_tube_1_desc:0 "The early SLBM tube was basic and the earliest designs had very limited capacity. Early SLBM tubes were based off the torpedo tube with heavy modifications made to accommodate the new weapon. However, most of the cost of developing submarine systems capable of launching nuclear weapons was in the extensive electronics systems necessary for targeting and aiming the missile rather than holding it themselves. Despite the incredible investment and foundations needed to develop the SLBM tube, submarines had very limited range and targeting capability due to the primitive nature of early electronics."
 slbm_tube_2:0 "SLBM Tube"
 slbm_tube_2_desc:0 "While early SLBM tubes had serious problems due to the limits of the technology at the time, improvements to computing technology greatly enabled submarines to hold far better targeting and aiming systems for SLBMs and also miniaturized the size of the on-board systems which could allow for more SLBM tubes or other systems.\nDue to the limits of HOI4 and the format of the module designer, this improved design increases SLBM capacity assuming the saved space goes toward increasing the number of tubes."
 slbm_tube_3:0 "Improved SLBM Tube"
 slbm_tube_3_desc:0 "Further improvements to the technology of SLBM tubes paved the way for even greater ranges and targeting capability. Recent advances in computing and electronics allows for better systems in the control of SLBMs. Additionally, SLBM tubes could be autoloaded and hold more SLBMs than before."
 slbm_tube_4:0 "Modern SLBM Tube"
 slbm_tube_4_desc:0 "Modern SLBM systems are capable of interoperability between the strategic network of a nation and the nuclear submarine network on a level unimagined before. Additionally, modern SLBM systems can allow nuclear submarines to target regions with extreme precision at incredibly long ranges. In combination with modern SLBMs, modern SLBM systems could allow nuclear submarines to strike anywhere in the world and truly ensure mutual destruction even in the event of a first strike crippling retaliation capability."
 slbm_silo_1:0 "SLBM Silo"
 slbm_silo_1_desc:0 "The SLBM silo is a large in-submarine silo developed to hold a large capacity of SLBM. This technology requires not only the systems of the optimized SLBM tube’s computer and targeting system but the development of in-submarine tight space logistical/storage/maintenance equipment required to handle to multitude of SLBMs needed and in-submarine SLBM reloading."
 slbm_silo_2:0 "Improved SLBM Silo"
 slbm_silo_2_desc:0 "Further adding to the improvements made to machinery and technology, the improved SLBM silo can come equipped with better logistics systems and allow for a greater capacity for SLBMs within’ the silo."
 slbm_silo_3:0 "Modern SLBM Silo"
 slbm_silo_3_desc:0 "Modern SLBM silos not only require the improvements to targeting capability that the tubes have, but also require larger levels of processing power needed for mass targeting and rapid deployment to empty the payload of the large modern silo."
 ww_screens:0 "WW2 Era Screen Ships"
 ww_screens_desc:0 "Screen ships during WWII were relatively small compared to the larger ships such as battleships. Destroyers, escorts, and light cruisers were the most common classifications of screen ships in the WW era. While WW era screen ships are an important foundation, they lack a lot of the important systems needed to support modern modules and run them properly. Additionally, new innovations in electronics and computing led to core changes in design doctrines and mandates and as such, they cannot be fielded or refitted with modules that require these innovations such as special weapons or modern electronics-heavy equipment."
 rhib_launch_1:0 "RHIB Platform"
 rhib_launch_1_desc:0 "The RHIB is a boat with a rigid hull and inflatables. They can be used for a variety of operations including aiding a ship’s patrols, provide aid for work efforts, transport troops, and be used as lifeboats. The earliest RHIB boats had limited uses and capacities compared to later designs, although this is owed almost entirely to indirect development efforts such as material research and small equipment benefits. Nonetheless, RHIB boats can be used to aid in naval patrols, maritime security, reducing accidents and repairing the ship if it has problems, and several other tasks."
 rhib_launch_2:0 "RHIB Deck"
 rhib_launch_2_desc:0 "Modernizing the RHIB with modern materials and indirect improvements made in other fields greatly improves their capacity and allows for a greater level of flexibility. However, there also need to be improvements to the RHIB launch itself including better facilities for retrieval and deployment, maintenance equipment, and the standardization of the deck itself."
 rhib_launch_3:0 "RHIB Hub"
 rhib_launch_3_desc:0 "Further improving RHIBs with modern equipment and auxiliaries can greatly aid in interoperability between RHIBs and the ship itself. Additionally, including wheelhouses alongside these auxiliaries can improve patrol efficiency."
 rhib_launch_4:0 "RHIB Center"
 rhib_launch_4_desc:0 "An advanced RHIB center fully equipped with RHIBs for a multitude of missions and purposes to greatly reduce ship accidents and aid in patrols."
 screen_aviation_1:0 "Basic Screen Aviation"
 screen_aviation_1_desc:0 "ASW helicopters are large helicopters that carry ASW missiles used for taking down submarines. These helicopters can help protect ships against submarines and move faster than either the ship or the submarine can. Outfitting platforms with a basic helipad and arming them with an ASW helicopter and its maintenance crew can greatly improve a ship’s anti-submarine capability."
 screen_aviation_2:0 "Screen Aviation"
 screen_aviation_2_desc:0 "While having a basic platform and a ASW helicopter is simple and effective, it isn’t enough to meet the needs of the modern army. Equipping a screen aviation facility with additional spare parts and all the equipment necessary to maintain the helicopter for an extended period while out at sea is necessary to ensure continuous, safe operations and continue the ship’s protection against submarines."
 screen_aviation_3:0 "Improved Screen Aviation"
 screen_aviation_3_desc:0 "Outfitting the screen aviation platform with auxiliaries and equipment to mount more modern helicopters is expensive but necessary in order to hold said modern helicopters."
 screen_aviation_4:0 "Modern Screen Aviation"
 screen_aviation_4_desc:0 "Modern screen aviation platforms come equipped with highly advanced electronic and mission control systems to aid interoperability between the helicopter and the ship. When combined with this modern equipment, ASW helicopters can achieve high levels of mission efficiency and protect their craft from submarines."
