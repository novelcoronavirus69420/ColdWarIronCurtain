 wgr.202.d:0 "The Election of 1961 has arrived. For the first time, the SPD has a chancellor-candidate, who is not chairman of the party: Willy Brandt, the Governing Mayor of West Berlin. After the building of the Berlin Wall, he gained more and more sympathy, while chancellor Konrad Adenauer was criticised for not showing enough support for the people of West Berlin. Adenauer had to save the absolute majority of CDU and CSU, but, considering his age and his long term as chancellor, there were big doubts if he should lead the country in a fourth term."
 #wgr.12.t:0 "Starfighter Crisis"
 #wgr.12.d:0 "It would seem our new fighters aren't as good as it seemed as we had several major accidents over last few days. Our experts theoretize that F-104 Starfighter simply isn't designed with our weather conditions in mind. We will have to find some solution."

The new party is called Vereinigte Sozialistische Partei, or the United socialist party. Official reports portray this merger as a voluntary pooling of efforts by the socialist parties. However, some suspect that the merger was more troubled than we are lead to believe."
 wgr.17.t:0 "Loss of Der Alte"
 wgr.17.d:0 "Konrad Hermann Joseph Adenauer, our first Chancellor, the father of Wirtschaftswunder and a belowed man has died in his family home in Rhöndorf. According to his daughter, his last words were \"Da jitt et nix zo kriesche!\" (Kölsch slang for \"There's nothin' to weep about!\"). His state funeral in Cologne Cathedral was attended by a large number of international guests. One hundred and eighty countries were represented, included fifteen world leaders.\nAfter the Requiem Mass and service, his remains were taken upstream to Rhöndorf on the Rhine aboard Kondor, with two more Seeadler-class fast attack craft of the German Navy, Seeadler and Sperber as escorts, \"past the thousands who stood in silence on both banks of the river\". He is interred at the Waldfriedhof at Rhöndorf.\nWhen Germans were asked what they admired most about Adenauer, the majority responded that he had brought home the last German prisoners of war from the USSR, which had become known as the \"Return of the 10,000\"."
 wgr.17.a:0 "Bleib du im ew'gen Leben"
 Ostpolitik.2.t:0 "Die Warschauer Vertrag"
 Ostpolitik.2.d:0 "Today sees another victory for Ostpolitik. In Warsaw, West German Chancellor [WGR.GetLeader] and Polish Prime Minister Józef Cyrankiewicz have signed the treaty of Warsaw. The treaty commits both sides to nonviolence along with accepting the existing border—the Oder-Neisse line, imposed on Germany by the Allied powers at the 1945 Potsdam Conference following the end of World War II.\nWhile Poland is happy about the agreement, the same can't be said for West Germany. There, the opposition, has marked this policy as a betrayal of national interests. At the time the treaty was signed, West German commentators sought to maintain that this could not be a final settlement of the Polish border issue, because Article IV of this treaty stated that previous treaties like the Potsdam Agreement were not superseded by this latest agreement; so it might be argued that the provisions of this treaty could be changed by a final peace treaty between Germany and the Allies of World War II—as provided for in the Potsdam Agreement."
 SDP_60s.1.t:0 "SDP Calls For Nuclear Free Europe"
 SDP_60s.1.d:0 "The ruling Social Democrat Party (SDP) of West Germany announced that it was calling for a nuclear free Europe. The government stated the people of Europe have long been held hostage by the nuclear arms race and the superpowers deploying such devastating weapons across Europe. The announcement has garnered support among not just Germans but Europeans across the continent who have felt powerless in the face of the nuclear threat. Across NATO there has been a growing sense of unease at the announcement. Some governments are privately sympathetic while others, especially the United States, view the announcement as potential sabotage that undermines the defense of Europe. There are even groups in the United States who are suggesting the announcement proves the SDP is a Soviet agent designed to sabotage NATO from the inside."
 Stammheim.1.t:0 "Opening of Stammheim Supermax"
 Stammheim.1.d:0 "West Germany opened a new supermax prison in Stuttgart. Called Stammheim Supermax Prison, the government believes the facility will be the most secure facility in the country. Indeed, the prison will not only house prisoners but have its own courthouse in which suspects maybe tried. This will prove especially useful in cases involving dangerous organizations as they will be unable to interfere with the legal process. The new warden noted the prison may end up being the not just the most secure prison in the country but perhaps even in the world. The prison took four years to be constructed and is expected to immediately house some of the most dangerous criminals and suspects."
 WGRPolitical.1.t:0 "The Grand Coalition"
 WGRPolitical.1.d:0 "With the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) coalition unraveled, it has announced the formation of a Grand Coalition with the Social Democratic Party (SDP). This will save the government as it lost its coalition allies but also ensure the coalition controls nearly ninety percent of the Bundestag. Considering the ideological differences between both parties, it is expected the government will have a difficult time maintaining control. For the CDU, this will mean a more tenuous ability to pass legislation and more compromises. For the SDP, the announcement has angered those aligned more to the left who see the Grand Coalition as a betrayal to party values. Student supporters of the SDP have expressed their outrage to the decision. Students are already preparing protests and to lead opposition to the coalition, but the new government believes it will be able to handle such dissent."
 WGRPolitical.2.t:0 "The Succession of Adeneaur"
 WGRPolitical.2.d:0 "Konrad Adenauer quickly became the leading politician of post-war West Germany. He benefitted after the war from being dismissed by the British for advocating his position as equal to the Allied authorities, gaining him national legitimacy. He then tirelessly worked to make the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) the leading national political party. As chancellor he advocated democratic norms and freedoms. However, he had promised the country he would resign before the end of his final term and following some recent scandals he cannot afford to hang on. The leading candidate to succeed him is Ludwig Erhard, the man who oversaw the post-war economic recovery and development of the country. Although Chancellor Adenauer has his misgivings about Erhard, the CDU is adamant and Erhard is set to take over as the second chancellor of West Germany"
 WGRPolitical.3.t:0 "Breakup of SDP and SDS"
 WGRPolitical.3.d:0 "The Social Democratic Party of West Germany (SDP) has formally announced its separation from the Socialist German Student Union (SDS). The SDS had formed shortly after the end of World War II as the college branch of the SDP. However, since independence it has continuously found itself at odds with the parent institution. Specifically, the SDS was strongly opposed to the rearming of West Germany which the SDP supported. In addition the SDS has expressed concern with the SDP working closely with mainstream parties  ideologically opposed to the SDP political tenants. The SDP has announced it will immediately expel all SDS members from its ranks. The SDS has announced it will act in the interest of the German people and workers and will not compromise its values for political gain or for foreign interests. More leftist members of the SDP are expected to switch loyalties."

 Elysee.1.t:0 "The Elysee Treaty"
 Elysee.1.d:0 "The President of France and Chancellor of West Germany today signed the Elysee Treaty in Paris. The treaty is meant to end decades of conflict and rivalry between the two continental European powers. The two states had been engaged in multiple armed conflicts from the nineteenth century to World War II. The treaty called for regular meetings between the two states. The heads of states are to regularly meet and an interministerial committee will coordinate cooperation between the two states. Both nations are to also coordinate defense and diplomatic cooperation amongst each other. The citizens of both countries welcome the treaty and eagerly await a new era of peace and cooperation between two of the most important land powers in Europe. The French government hopes this may lead to the establishment of a closer alliance to challenge Soviet and American hegemony, but time will tell if West Germany will share this long-term goal."
 Ostpolitik.3.d:0 "The West German government and Soviet Union recently concluded a new treaty called the Moscow Treaty. The two governments have agreed to normalize relations with one another. They also pledged keep international peace, renounce the use of arms, and agreed to the post-World War II borders. The treaty reflects the new policy of Ostpolitik being implemented by the current German government. By signing the treaty, West Germany has accepted its border with East Germany and for the moment is not pushing for German self-determination. More significantly, the government has accepted Poland controlling most of former East Prussia. Many in West Germany have expressed satisfaction with the reduction of tension but there is also discontent over the sacrifice of German borders and self-determination. The United States has expressed concern with this treaty."
 WGR_Pol.1.d:0 "Following World War II, the Allied powers agreed to give historical East Prussia to Poland. The Soviet Union implemented this ruling, ensuring East German acceptance. However, West Germany stated the post-war agreement was meant to be decided at a future date and the Polish occupation is unconfirmed. Today, the West German government reiterated its claims to East Prussia and stated German unification includes the restoration of East Prussia to the nation. The Soviet Union and Poland both called the statement provocative and an indication that West Germany harbors fascist territorial desires that threaten peace in Europe. The West German announcement has received support from many in the country but there is a large portion of the population who find the announcement to be far too provocative in the current political climate."
 RedArmyFaction.20.t:0 "The Stammheim trial"
 RedArmyFaction.20.d:0 "The Red Army Faction (RAF) is a far-left militant organization conducting attacks across West Germany. The recent escalation in violence, kidnapping, and killings has led to a national crisis across West Germany. Many in Germany have grown suspicious that left leaning mainstream parties maybe ideologically connected to the militants. In this tense environment it has been decided to initiate a crackdown on the RAF. The security forces will more intensely work to arrest members and uproot the organization. Arrested RAF members will be detained in complete isolation from the media and not be allowed to make public statements. The intense isolation will also include banning members from meeting lawyers or family either. Although many Germans applaud the crackdown, there are many who fear suppressing RAF members rights reflects too much of the authoritarian past Germany has tried to put behind itself."
 Ostpolitik.4.d:0 "In Erfurt, the leaders of West Germany met for the first time with the leaders of East Germany. The meeting was said to be a success as both sides agreed to the need for greater communication and expressed a desire for de-escalation. It is expected from this summit that more interactions are to occur with the eventual goal being a normalization of relations between the two German nations. Although the summit is being hailed as key to achieving lasting peace and potential unification, many in the opposition in West Germany have expressed outrage. They argue the meeting legitimizes the East German regime and will only lead to a more permanent division of Germany. They call the summit a betrayal of the German people. Regardless, the summit appears to be a success of the West German effort at implementing Ostpolitik, a policy designed to ease tensions and normalize relations between West Germany and eastern Europe."
