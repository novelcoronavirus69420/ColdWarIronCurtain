 Purge_Gottwald.1.d:0 "Klement Gottwald, President of Czechoslovakia and senior member of the Communist Party has been purged by the head of the party, Rudolf Slansky. Although the two men were close collaborators, following the institution of communist rule in the country, both were said to be trying to consolidate power over the other. In addition, there has been increasing pressure from Moscow for the party to purge traitors and nationalists who undermine the party. Slansky managed to act first, during a recent meeting of the Central Committee he accused Gottwald of encouraging nationalism, dragging his feet on implementing nationalization, and sympathies to enemies of the revolution. Gottwald was unable to rally support and was taken into custody by the police. In an address to the nation, Rudolf Slansky announced he had saved the country from a betrayer and that he would take on the role of president."
 Czechoslovakia_Purge.3.d:0 "A series of show trials were recently concluded in Czechoslovakia targeting non-communist political activists, nationalists, Catholics, and communist dissidents. As the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSC) consolidates power it needs to assert its dominance over a country unfamiliar with one party rule. The accused faced charges of conspiring to overthrow the government, affiliating with foreign intelligence agencies, collaborating with Nazis during the war, and corruption among other charges. Those connected to people or groups perceived anti-party are also being blacklisted from jobs and education opportunities. The Soviet Union is said to be encouraging these trials and have praised the KSC leadership for its proactive action in uprooting threats to the people of Czechoslovakia."

 toufar.1.d:0 "On 11 December, 1949, the third Sunday in Advent, churchgoers in the village of Cihost reported a miracle - the half meter iron cross in the local church had moved by itself. Though the priest Josef Toufar has claimed that he did not see this supposed miracle, it must be a trick on his part! We can let this be, or we can use this event to discredit the Catholic Church further by coaxing a confession from the priest!"				#The Toufar Miracle
 toufar.2.d:0 "The priest Josef Toufar has stayed resilient under our advanced interrogation techniques, though he is notably weakened. We can continue our interrogation, but there is a chance he will not survive."
 toufar.3.d:0 "The priest Josef Toufar has died under our advanced interrogation techniques! We were unable to extract any information from the traitorous priest."
 toufar.4.d:0 "The priest Josef Toufar has been resilient in our coaxing process. However, Toufar eventually caved, admitting his trickery. Though it took weeks of advanced interrogation, he admitted that he had installed a small mechanical device that ran from the pulpit to the large iron cross to make the cross move in order to deceive the parishioners. We have brought him to the church to film a recreation of his trickery, but he is far too weak from weeks of our advanced interrogation. We have replaced him with another priest for some shots. "
 toufar.5.d:0 "The priest Josef Toufar has succumbed to injuries and malnourishment sustained during our long interrogation process. His extended hospital stay in a state hospital in Prague ended early this morning when his body was moved out under a false name. Fortunately, we no longer have any need for him."
